                        The B.Tech. Program in Computer Science Engineering is a four-year program
                        with selection through the IIT Joint Entrance Examination. It provides
                        students with a strong foundation in core computer science principles.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Students are encouraged to work on research projects from their second year
                        onwards, in addition to coursework and a semester-long B.Tech. project
                        offered in the seventh semester. Projects often involve interdisciplinary
                        collaboration with faculty members from multiple domains.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The strong and interactive curriculum, paired with practical hands-on
                        experience, equips students to pursue advanced studies or excel in
                        professional engineering careers.
